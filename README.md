## About the code

This repo contains the Front-end for the project. The backend code is submoduled (can be accessed from the repo, or directly [here](https://github.com/satwikkansal/netzero-backend)).

## Instructions to run

To get started with this project, clone this repo and follow the commands below

### Frontend

#### One-time setup

- Create a `.env` file referring to the sample `.env.example` file. Since this is a demo project we're putting keypair info in the `.env` of the frontend source. **Please DON'T put your mainnet keys in .env, this can lead to loss of real funds.** For production use, it is recommended to mint NFTs either at the backend or from the DAO contract (better).
- Run `npm install` at the root of your directory to install the dependencies. It is recommended you use node v18 or higher.

#### Recurring Instructions

After the one-time setup is done, just run `npm start` to start the project!

PS: This is our submission for Beyond Blockchain: Hashgraph Hackathon, we intend to take this project further post-hackathon.
